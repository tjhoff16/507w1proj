This project has 3 distinct functionalities.

1) It creates a single card or a standard deck of playing cards using Classes, and allows the ability to deal, 'pop' off, sort, and shuffle the cards.

2) It will automatically play a game of war, and print the scores and which of the two players won on the command line.

3) It will take a string as input and search the iTunes API for songs related to that string, then randomly select one to return.

There are some unsolved bugs in this code. SI507F17_project1_tests.py has tests for the functionality of the code and will allow you to find some of the bugs.
